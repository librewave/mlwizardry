            "[10:30.120 --> 10:35.640]  too. But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post and the heaviness of\n",
            "[10:35.640 --> 10:41.720]  these emails. These people were writing with intense frustration about what procrastination had\n",
            "[10:41.720 --> 10:49.960]  done to their lives, about what this monkey had done to them. And I thought about this and I said,\n",

            "[11:00.680 --> 11:04.680]  today, the examples I've given, they all have deadlines. And when there's deadlines, the effects of\n",
            "[11:04.680 --> 11:09.720]  procrastination are contained to the short term because the panic monster gets involved. But there's\n",
            "[11:09.720 --> 11:15.160]  a second kind of procrastination that happens in situations when there is no deadline. So if you\n",

            "[11:32.280 --> 11:37.240]  or exercising and taking care of your health, working on your relationship, or getting out of\n",

            "[11:49.320 --> 11:53.560]  the panic monster doesn't show up. He has nothing to wake up for. So the effects of procrastination,\n",
            "[11:53.560 --> 12:00.360]  they're not contained. They just extend outward forever. And it's this long term kind of procrastination\n",
